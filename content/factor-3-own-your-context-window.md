### 3. Own your context window

You don't necessarily need to use standard message-based formats for conveying context to an LLM.

> #### At any given point, your input to an LLM in an agent is "here's what's happened so far, what's the next step"

<!-- todo syntax highlighting -->
<!-- ![130-own-your-context-building](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/130-own-your-context-building.png) -->

Again, I don't know what's the best way to hand context to an LLM, but I know you want the flexibility to be able to try EVERYTHING.


#### Standard vs Custom Context Formats

Most LLM clients use a standard message-based format like this:

```yaml
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a helpful assistant..."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Can you deploy the backend?"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": null,
    "tool_calls": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "list_git_tags",
        "arguments": "{}"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "tool",
    "name": "list_git_tags",
    "content": "{\"tags\": [{\"name\": \"v1.2.3\", \"commit\": \"abc123\", \"date\": \"2024-03-15T10:00:00Z\"}, {\"name\": \"v1.2.2\", \"commit\": \"def456\", \"date\": \"2024-03-14T15:30:00Z\"}, {\"name\": \"v1.2.1\", \"commit\": \"abe033d\", \"date\": \"2024-03-13T09:15:00Z\"}]}",
    "tool_call_id": "1"
  }
]
```

While this works great for most use cases, if you want to really get THE MOST out of today's LLMs, you need to get your context into the LLM is the most token- and attention-efficient way you can.

As an alternative to the standard message-based format, you can build your own context format that's optimized for your use case. For example, you can using custom objects and pack/spread them into one or more user, system, assistant, or tool messages as makes sense.

Here's an example of putting the whole context window into a single user message:
```yaml

[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a helpful assistant..."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": |
            Here's everything that happened so far:
        
        <slack_message>
            From: @alex
            Channel: #deployments
            Text: Can you deploy the backend?
        </slack_message>
        
        <list_git_tags>
            intent: "list_git_tags"
        </list_git_tags>
        
        <list_git_tags_result>
            tags:
              - name: "v1.2.3"
                commit: "abc123"
                date: "2024-03-15T10:00:00Z"
              - name: "v1.2.2"
                commit: "def456"
                date: "2024-03-14T15:30:00Z"
              - name: "v1.2.1"
                commit: "ghi789"
                date: "2024-03-13T09:15:00Z"
        </list_git_tags_result>
        
        what's the next step?
    }
]
```

Not that the model may infer that you're asking it `what's the next step` but it never hurts to roll it into your prompt template.

We can build this with something like: 

```python

class Thread:
  events: List[Event]

class Event:
  # could just use string, or could be explicit - up to you
  type: Literal["list_git_tags", "deploy_backend", "deploy_frontend", "request_more_information", "done_for_now", "list_git_tags_result", "deploy_backend_result", "deploy_frontend_result", "request_more_information_result", "done_for_now_result", "error"]
  data: ListGitTags | DeployBackend | DeployFrontend | RequestMoreInformation |  
        ListGitTagsResult | DeployBackendResult | DeployFrontendResult | RequestMoreInformationResult | string

def event_to_prompt(event: Event) -> str:
    data = event.data if isinstance(event.data, str) \
           else stringifyToYaml(event.data)

    return f"<{event.type}>\n{data}\n</{event.type}>"


def thread_to_prompt(thread: Thread) -> str:
  return '\n\n'.join(event_to_prompt(event) for event in thread.events)
```

#### Example Context Windows

Here's how context windows might look with this approach:

**Initial Slack Request:**
```xml
<slack_message>
    From: @alex
    Channel: #deployments
    Text: Can you deploy the latest backend to production?
</slack_message>
```

**After Listing Git Tags:**
```xml
<slack_message>
    From: @alex
    Channel: #deployments
    Text: Can you deploy the latest backend to production?
    Thread: []
</slack_message>

<list_git_tags>
    intent: "list_git_tags"
</list_git_tags>

<list_git_tags_result>
    tags:
      - name: "v1.2.3"
        commit: "abc123"
        date: "2024-03-15T10:00:00Z"
      - name: "v1.2.2"
        commit: "def456"
        date: "2024-03-14T15:30:00Z"
      - name: "v1.2.1"
        commit: "ghi789"
        date: "2024-03-13T09:15:00Z"
</list_git_tags_result>
```

**After Error and Recovery:**
```xml
<slack_message>
    From: @alex
    Channel: #deployments
    Text: Can you deploy the latest backend to production?
    Thread: []
</slack_message>

<deploy_backend>
    intent: "deploy_backend"
    tag: "v1.2.3"
    environment: "production"
</deploy_backend>

<error>
    error running deploy_backend: Failed to connect to deployment service
</error>

<request_more_information>
    intent: "request_more_information_from_human"
    question: "I had trouble connecting to the deployment service, can you provide more details and/or check on the status of the service?"
</request_more_information>

<human_response>
    data:
      response: "I'm not sure what's going on, can you check on the status of the latest workflow?"
</human_response>
```

From here your next step might be: 

```python
nextStep = await determine_next_step(thread_to_prompt(thread))
```

```python
{
  "intent": "get_workflow_status",
  "workflow_name": "tag_push_prod.yaml",
}
```

The XML-style format is just one example - the point is you can build your own format that makes sense for your application. You'll get better quality if you have the flexibility to experiment with different context structures and what you store vs. what you pass to the LLM. 

Key benefits of owning your context window:
1. **Information Density**: Structure information in ways that maximize the LLM's understanding
2. **Error Handling**: Include error information in a format that helps the LLM recover
3. **Safety**: Control what information gets passed to the LLM, filtering out sensitive data
4. **Flexibility**: Adapt the format as you learn what works best for your use case

Remember: The context window is your primary interface with the LLM. Taking control of how you structure and present information can dramatically improve your agent's performance.

Recurring theme here: I don't know what's the best approach, but I know you want the flexibility to be able to try EVERYTHING.
