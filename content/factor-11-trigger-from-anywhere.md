### 11. Trigger from anywhere, meet users where they are

If you're waiting for the [humanlayer](https://humanlayer.dev) pitch, you made it. If you're doing [factor 6 - launch/pause/resume with simple APIs](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-6-launch-pause-resume.md) and [factor 7 - contact humans with tool calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-7-contact-humans-with-tools.md), you're ready to incorporate this factor.

Enable users to trigger agents from slack, email, sms, or whatever other channel they want. Enable agents to respond via the same channels.

Benefits:

- **Meet users where they are**: This helps you build AI applications that feel like real humans, or at the very least, digital coworkers.
- **Outer Loop Agents**: Enable agents to be triggered by non-humans, e.g. events, crons, outages, whatever else. They may work for 5, 20, 90 minutes, but when they get to a critical point, they can contact a human for help, feedback, or approval.
